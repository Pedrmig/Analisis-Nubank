# Machine Learning Model for Nubank Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of a machine learning model based on a sample dataset from Nubank's data analysis. 
A predictive model has been developed and, using Streamlit, an organized analysis of some results from Nubank and the database analysis are presented.

## About Nubank

Nubank is a Brazilian neobank headquartered in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Founded in 2013, it is considered the largest digital bank in the world outside of Asia and one of the largest fintech companies in Latin America. In 2019, it was recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the world by the American magazine Fast Company.

In just six years, Nubank became the sixth-largest bank in Brazil, ranking among the top five credit card issuers and reaching 20 million customers by early 2020. Between mid-2018 and the end of 2019 (according to a study by Apptopia), its app was downloaded more times than the top three neobanks in Europe combined.
